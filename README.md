# SL-3D-Scanning-Software
**Project Overview**
This project provides a lightweight yet extensible tool for capturing 3D scans using the Artec Eva scanner. Itâ€™s designed to offer a simple and reliable interface for users who need to quickly acquire, save, and export 3D scan data, while also serving as a foundation for developers who want to build more advanced functionality on top of the Artec 3D SDK.

**Goals**
Core Functionality:
  - At a minimum, the tool enables users to:
  - Initiate and control 3D scans with the Artec Eva
  - Save individual scan sessions
  - Export scan data in standard file formats (e.g., .obj, .ply, .stl)

Extended Capabilities (Work in Progress):
The long-term goal is to create a fully featured scanning utility that takes full advantage of the Artec 3D SDK. 

Planned features include:
  - Real-time scan previews
  - Session management and scan history
  - Basic scan editing and alignment tools
  - Batch export options and format conversion

Why This Project?
The official Artec Studio software is powerful but may be overkill or cost-prohibitive for certain workflows. This project provides a streamlined, open solution focused on automation, accessibility, and extensibility.
